## PIO ##
 
 After reading chapter 3 in the Pico C SDK manual as given in resources of my setup guide https://github.com/AkshayaBhati/ESE-519-Lab-2-Setup-Guide/blob/main/README.md
 we can understand how the PIO Module interacts with a WS2812 module. 
 
 *Why is bit-banging impractical on your laptop, despite it having a
much faster processor than the RP2040?*
*What are some cases where directly using the GPIO might be a
better choice than using the PIO hardware?*
*How do you get data into a PIO state machine?*
*How do you get data out of a PIO state machine?*
*How do you program a PIO state machine?*
*In the example, which low-level C SDK function is directly
responsible for telling the PIO to set the LED to a new color? How
is this function accessed from the main “application” code?*
*What role does the pioasm “assembler” play in the example, and
how does this interact with CMake?*
